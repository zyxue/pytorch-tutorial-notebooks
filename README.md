This repo simply host a Jupyter notebook version of the PyTorch tutorials at
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/

Contributions are welcome.

Basic format:

The top of each tutorial shows the link, and the content structure (e.g.
headers: `h2` => `##`, `h3` => `###`)follows that of the tutorial page, so does
the directory.
